# EaseBot: A Mental Health Companion Chatbot

EaseBot is a **terminal-based mental health companion chatbot** designed for users aged **19â€“25**.  
It acts as a **friend and companion**, helping users express emotions, reflect on their mental state, and receive gentle guidance during low times.  

The chatbot is trained on various age-specific and emotion-based datasets, making it more empathetic and tailored to young adults.  
This project does **not** have a GUI â€” it runs directly in the terminal.
